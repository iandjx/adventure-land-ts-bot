# adventure-land-ts-client
## Description
This is a work in progress 4-person bot for https://adventure.land/ code. Instead of using built-in functions of Adventure Land, I took advantage of AlClient (https://github.com/earthiverse/ALClient), an Adventure Land client built from ground up, for strongly typed classes and functions. 

## To run
1. Buy https://store.steampowered.com/app/777150/Adventure_Land__The_Code_MMORPG/
2. add an env file with EMAIL and PASSWORD of your account
3. yarn && yarn dev
